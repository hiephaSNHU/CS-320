**1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
Ensuring that my software is functional and secure involves thorough unit testing, boundary testing, and exception handling. For example, in Project Two, I implemented tests to validate edge cases and input constraints, such as ensuring unique IDs, valid names, and future dates for appointments.
Additionally, I adopted practices like validating inputs rigorously and testing for invalid scenarios to handle exceptions properly. These steps reduce vulnerabilities and ensure robustness.

**2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Understanding user needs starts with analyzing requirements to identify the core functionalities and constraints. In these projects, I translated requirements into specific features, such as restricting appointment dates to the future or ensuring task descriptions met length limits. I then validated these implementations through testing to confirm they met the expected behaviors.

**3. How do I approach designing software?**
My approach to software design emphasizes clarity and modularity. I began by breaking down the requirements into manageable components (e.g., Contact, Task, and Appointment services). Each component was designed with single-responsibility principles, ensuring ease of testing and maintenance. I also prioritized input validation and error handling to ensure reliability.
